1. What is interceptor in angular?


Ans=> In Angular, interceptors are classes that can be used to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses. 
They provide a way to modify or handle HTTP requests globally before they are sent to the server or to modify the HTTP responses before 
they are delivered to the calling code. Interceptors are useful for tasks like adding authentication headers, logging, error handling, caching, and more.
  Intercepting Requests:
When an HTTP request is made, interceptors can intercept and modify the request before it is sent to the server.

  Intercepting Responses:
Similarly, interceptors can intercept and modify the response received from the server before it reaches your application's components.

Centralized Logic:
Interceptors provide a centralized place to handle common tasks related to HTTP communication.

  Example Use Cases:
Authentication: Attach authentication tokens to requests or refresh tokens automatically.
Error Handling: Centralize error-handling logic and respond consistently to errors.
Logging: Log requests, responses, or errors for debugging and monitoring.
Loading Indicators: Start and stop loading indicators during HTTP requests for a smoother user experience.
